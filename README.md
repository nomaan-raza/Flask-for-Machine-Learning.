# Flask-for-Machine-Learning.

Flask is often used to deploy trained models as web services. This allows users to interact with the models through a user-friendly interface or API, enabling real-world applications of machine learning solutions.

Flask is a popular Python micro-framework frequently utilized for deploying machine learning models as web services or APIs. Its lightweight nature and flexibility make it an ideal choice for this purpose, allowing users to interact with trained models through a user-friendly interface or by sending requests to an API endpoint.

-- Model Integration:
Trained machine learning models (often saved using techniques like pickling or joblib) are loaded within the Flask application. When a request is received, the application uses the loaded model to make predictions based on the input data.

-- API Endpoints:
Flask allows the creation of specific routes (API endpoints) that handle incoming requests. For machine learning, these endpoints typically receive input data, pass it to the loaded model for prediction, and return the model's output (e.g., predicted class, numerical value).

-- Dependencies:
When deploying a Flask application with a machine learning model, it's crucial to manage dependencies using a requirements.txt file, ensuring that all necessary libraries (Flask, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.) are installed in the deployment environment.

-- Deployment:
Flask applications can be deployed on various platforms, including cloud services like Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud, allowing the machine learning model to be accessible and scalable in a production environment.
